% A Sample Thesis for the University of Calgary
% =============================================

% This is a sample LaTeX document to build a University of Calgary
% graduate thesis according to the guidelines of the Faculty of
% Graduate Studies, available here:
% https://grad.ucalgary.ca/current-students/thesis-based-students/thesis/building-thesis

% To use this sample for your own thesis, rename this file, make any changes
% necessary, then add the content of your thesis to the included files
% frontmatter.tex, chapter1.tex, etc.

% First, we load the UCalgary Memoir Thesis class ucalgmthesis,
% available at https://github.com/rzach/ucalgmthesis

% By default (without options), this produces a 1-1/2 spaced thesis in
% 11 point font without running heads. See the README file for a
% description of all package options.

% In our sample we give three options: Option "utopia" sets the thesis
% in a nice font: Utopia in this case. Other font options are "times",
% "garamond", "palatino", and "libertine". Try them out to see what
% you like best.  If you do not provide a font option, the thesis is
% set in LaTeX's Computer Modern font. 

% Option "headers" produces running heads. 

% Option "manuscript" formats
% the page in a way suitable for reading and commenting: 12 pt type,
% double spaced, approx. 25 lines per page, with approx. 72 characters
% per line. For filing in the Vault, remove that option to produce a
% more compact thesis with a slightly better layout.

\documentclass[utopia,headers,manuscript]{ucalgmthesis}

% We'll need some colored links, so we load xcolor and hyperref. But
% you can take that out if you don't want links at all.

\usepackage[dvipsnames]{xcolor}

% microtype makes everything look better

\usepackage{microtype}

% You can turn off the boxes around links made by hyperref. Then links
% will appear in a different color, and per guidelines, all links must
% be blue or black. For blue links say

\usepackage[colorlinks,allcolors=MidnightBlue]{hyperref} 

% For black links, replace the above with:
% \usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}

% If you prefer hyperref's boxes around links (which don't print), you
% can also change their color. With boxes around links, you probably
% don't want everything in the table of contents to be a link, so we
% only make the page numbers links.
%
% \usepackage[allbordercolors=Periwinkle,linktocpage]{hyperref}

% The table of contents in your PDF reader's sidebar is just titles by
% default, but it's nice to also have chapter and section numbers for
% easy navigation.

\usepackage[numbered]{bookmark}

% Using LaTeX? Then you're probably using math, and so you want to use
% the AMS math commands and define some theorem environments! But you
% can take these out or use your own favorite theorem package.

\usepackage{amsmath,amsthm}

\newtheorem{thm}{Theorem}
\theoremstyle{definition}
\newtheorem{defn}[thm]{Definition} % please number all of them together!

% For author-year references, you probably want to use natbib with a
% bibliography style appropriate for your discipline; or check out
% biblatex!

\usepackage[round]{natbib}
\bibliographystyle{plainnat}

% The blindtext package produces the ``lorem ipsum''
% texts in this sample and can safely be removed.

\usepackage{blindtext}

% Now we put in the information for the thesis title page.

% Full Name

\author{Jane Mary Doe}

% Full Title

\title{An Important Contribution to the Literature}

% Official name of the degree

\degree{Doctor of Philosophy}

% The full name of the graduate program (not the department!). For
% interdisciplinary degrees, the home graduate program is listed
% first, followed by the word "and," then the other graduate program
% is listed

\prog{Graduate Program in Philosophy}

% The month (for the final version: when you file, not when you defended)

\monthname{May}

% The year

\thesisyear{2021}

% Tell hyperref to put author and title into the PDF metadata

\hypersetup{pdfinfo={Title={\thetitle},Author={\theauthor}}}

% If you want memoir to produce endnotes, turn them on here

\makepagenote

% Often you only want to output a single chapter so you can send it to
% your supervisor. Use includeonly and make sure everything you don't
% always want compiled to PDF is include'd from a separate file. For
% instance, to produce a PDF only of chapter 1, endnotes and
% bibliography, say

% \includeonly{chapter1,backmatter}

% To compile only the title page, which you need when submitting your
% thesis, say

% \includeonly{titlepage}

% and then copy the resulting PDF to a separate file.

% Memoir by default numbers document divisions from sections up. If
% you want subsections numbered as well, uncomment the following line:

% \maxsecnumdepth{subsection}

\begin{document}

\frontmatter

% titlepage.tex just makes the titlepage; it's in its own file so you
% can typeset it alone using includeonly.

\include{titlepage}

% frontmatter.tex contains the abstract, preface, acknowledgments, and
% the commands to produce the table of contents, list of tables, etc.

\include{frontmatter}

% The main matter of the thesis contains the actual content, separated
% into chapters.

\mainmatter

\include{chapter1}

\include{chapter2}

% The back matter includes commands to produce endnotes, index,
% glossary, bibliography, and the like.

\backmatter

\include{backmatter}

% The appendix contains material that would clutter up the main text,
% such as program code, survey instruments, or interview transcripts.
% Remove it if you don't have an appendix.

\appendix

\include{appendix}

\end{document}
